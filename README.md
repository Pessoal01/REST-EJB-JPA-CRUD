# REST-EJB-JPA-CRUD

This repository is just an example on how to create a provider of REST resources as well as invoking them from the server directly or from client application. These REST resources enable us to perform CRUD operation using particular HTTP methods i.e. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

Requirements:

1. Netbeans 8.1
2. Maven
3. Java EE
4. Java SE
5. EJB 3
6. Hibernate (JPA 2.1)
7. JPQL
8. JAX-RS
9. Wildfly 10.1.0.Final (Make sure you have created the required file and directory for adding MySQL's jdbc driver, configure the datasource name in standalone-full.xml inside your wildfly directory and put the datasource name defined in persistence.xml)
9. MySQL
